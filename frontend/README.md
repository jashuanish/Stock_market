üöÄ Project Title: stock market
A brief and engaging description of your React application. What does it do? What problem does it solve?

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Version 14 or higher (Recommended: use the current LTS version).

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn.

You can check your Node.js and npm versions using the following commands:

node -v
npm -v

üì¶ Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get your development environment running.

1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

2. Install Dependencies
Install all the required project dependencies listed in package.json:

# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install

3. Install Lucide Icons
This project uses lucide-react for sharp, accessible, and highly customizable SVG icons.

Install the library using your package manager:

# Using npm
npm install lucide-react

# Or using yarn
yarn add lucide-react

Usage Example:

import { Zap } from 'lucide-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <button className="flex items-center space-x-2 bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-lg">
      <Zap size={20} />
      <span>Power On</span>
    </button>
  );
}

üé® Tailwind CSS Configuration
This project is styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid and utility-first styling. The setup assumes you are using a standard React setup (like Create React App or Vite) with PostCSS.

1. Configuration Check
Ensure the following configuration files exist and are correctly set up:

tailwind.config.js
This file defines your theme, custom colors, and which files Tailwind should scan for utility classes.

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  // CRITICAL: Ensure this 'content' array covers all your source files (.jsx, .tsx, .js, .ts, etc.)
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

src/index.css (or equivalent global CSS file)
Your main CSS file must include the Tailwind directives at the top:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* You can add your custom global styles below here */
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

üöÄ Running the Application
To start the development server and view the app in your browser, run the start script:

# Using npm
npm start

# Or using yarn
yarn dev

The application will typically be accessible at: http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:5173 for Vite).

The app will automatically reload if you edit any source files.
